          <p class="ae-2"><span class="opacity-8">Immersography understands the importance of your personal privacy.  Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy so that you know how we use and disclose your information when you make it available to us.  The Privacy Policy below discloses our practices regarding information collection and usage website located at www.immersography.com, the related mobile website, and the mobile application (collectively, the “Websites”) and the service provided thereon (the “Service”).</span></p>
 
          <p class="ae-2"><span class="opacity-8">By using or accessing the Websites and the Service, you signify your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SERVICE OR PARTICIPA­­TE IN OUR SERVICES.</span></p>
 
          <p class="ae-2"><span class="opacity-8">Key aspects of our privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy include the following explanations:</span></p>
 
          <ul style="margin: 20px;" class="ae-2">
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">The information we collect and why we collect it;</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">How we use that information;</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">How we share information; and</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">The choices we offer.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="smallest margin-top-4 margin-bottom-2 ae-3">Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect:</h2>
 
          <p class="ae-4"><span class="opacity-8">We may ask you for, or you may voluntarily submit, personally identifiable information when you are using the Service. The personally identifiable information which you may provide to us could include, but is not limited to:</span></p>
 
          <ul style="margin: 20px;" class="ae-4">
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">Your name</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">Your contact information (including, without limitation, address and email address);</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">Your IP address; and</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">Other personal information.</li>
          </ul> 
 
          <h2 class="smallest margin-top-4 margin-bottom-2 ae-3">Non-Personal Or Aggregate Information That We Collect:</h2>

          <p class="ae-4"><span class="opacity-8">When you access our Service, we may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information from you, such as IP host address, web pages viewed, browser type, operating system, referring service, search information, device type, page views, usage and browsing habits on the Service and similar data. We may also aggregate demographic information collected from our users (such as the number of users in a particular geographical location) in a manner which does not identify any one individual.   We may also aggregate information collected offline in connection with the Service, obtain non-personally identifiable information from third party sources and develop aggregate information by anonymizing previously collected personally identifiable information.</span></p>
          
          <p class="ae-4"><span class="opacity-8">It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable information through automatic means that we may unintentionally collect or receive personally identifiable information that is mixed in with the non-personally identifiable information.  While we will make reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data collection, the possibility still exists.  If you believe that we have inadvertently collected your personal information, please notify us at info@immersography.com.</span></p>
 
          <h2 class="smallest margin-top-4 margin-bottom-2 ae-3">Information Usage:</h2>

          <p class="ae-4"><span class="opacity-8">We will only use your personally identifiable information as described below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use, either at the time the personally identifiable information is collected from you or through some other form of consent from you or notification to you:</span></p>
 
          <ul style="margin: 20px;" class="ae-4">
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">We may share your personally identifiable information collected in connection with providing the Service.</li>

            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">We may use your personally identifiable information to send you emails from time to time  about our services, but we will not provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for them to contact you directly unless otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy or you provide your consent.</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties (collectively, the “Third 
          Party Vendors”) to further the purpose for which you provided such information to us. For example, we may share your information with Elastic Email, for the purpose of sending emails. <strong>We urge you to read the privacy practices of all of our Third Party Vendors before submitting any personally identifiable information through the Service.</strong></li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">We may disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or legal process.</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">We may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, or the terms or policies for our services or our sponsors.</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">We may transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with the sale or merger 
          or change of control of Immersography or the division responsible for the services with which your personally identifiable information is associated.</li>
            <li style="list-style: circle;" class="opacity-8">We may share your personally identifiable information with an affiliate of Immersography who is in the same corporate family as us as long as their privacy practices are substantially similar to ours.</li>
          </ul> 

          <p class="ae-4"><span class="opacity-8">Non-personally identifiable or aggregate information may be used by us for any purposes permitted by law and may be shared with any number of parties, provided that such information shall not specifically identify you.</span></p>

          <h2 class="smallest margin-top-4 margin-bottom-2 ae-3">Cookies and Similar Technologies:</h2>

          <p class="ae-4"><span class="opacity-8">Like many services, the Analytics Service uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how visitors use our site. We then use the information to compile reports and to help us improve our site. </span></p>

          <p class="ae-4"><span class="opacity-8">Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. These cookies are used to store information, such as the time that the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before and what site referred the visitor to the web page. </span></p>

          <p class="ae-4"><span class="opacity-8">The Analytics Service collects information anonymously. They report website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of the Analytics Service without affecting how you visit our site.
